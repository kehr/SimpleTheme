You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

```ruby  
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	printf("Hello Jekyll !");
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install vim
```
